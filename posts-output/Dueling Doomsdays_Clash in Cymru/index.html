</code></pre><p>Let's get into it. Reports written by their respective pilots:</p><h3 id="round&#95;1">Round 1</h3><p>**Player: ApeofJustice<br /> Opponent: Ben (the eventual tournament winner)<br /> Opposing Deck: ANT<br /> Result: 1-2**</p><p>Playing against Ben (the eventual tournament winner), who I knew was playing ANT even before going into the match. On the draw.<br /> G1) I get killed on T1, oh well, what you gunna do. Can’t help that’s just how it sometimes goes. <br /> G2) This game was quite grindy, with lots of hand disruption thrown between each player, Ben does a mini Tendrils against me quite early on. I soon draw a Surgical Extraction, and target his Tendrils of Agony; Ben concedes in response. Obviously didn’t side in or maindeck any Empty the Warrens. <br /> G3) On the draw I keep a hand that is solid with some disruption, mana and DD, but no cantrips. Ben kept a 7 so I didn’t feel I could justify going below with this serviceable hand. Ben just Ponders on his turn, shuffles, then passes. I feel somewhat confident with the shuffle, and draw another Doomsday for turn. I Duress him on my T1, and take a Brainstorm seeing a hand of Flooded Strand, Lotus Petal, LED, and 2 Cabal Rituals. Then with no cantrips, I don’t feel confident letting this game going long, so I set up a pass the turn pile with Laboratory Maniac, going straight to 10 life. If he draws a tutor, or the Tendrils I die, but that is only a 5 outer, so Im quite happy playing against those odds. Ben hits a Ponder, shuffles, and hits the Tutor. GG</p><p>**Player: Doishy<br /> Opponent: Sammie<br /> Opposing Deck: Miracles<br /> Result: 0-2**<br /></p><p>Round 1 vs Sammie on Miracles. I have played him before and he was on a UW Delver brew so I suspected  counterspells et al. I have an early combo but he has maindeck fluster! I rebuild and try to find things but a Mentor gets going and I get pressured. I have the kill ready but after checking the coast he has counterspell, SCM x2 and that first Fluster in the yard. I manage to bait the CSpell, Thoughtseize a Snappy but he still has the last. Here I had a line whereby I could bait the Fluster with a DD and then grab a  second DD off the top to then win (or maybe it was BW into ToA or something?) basically I go to bait with  DD and he lets it resolve....oh dear! I have to go for it but he has the Fluster and hits something and  Mentor tokens kill me because I don't have enough resources to make a pile involving a CT first or anything ( not that it would help). Game 2 I have a really nice opener with a Trop and Xantid. He starts T0 with Leyline of Sanct. Huh, well should be fine if Swarm hits. I T1 Swarm and we stick it. He T1 goes land and  Brainstorm. I cantrip and set up a T3 kill. He flips a Terminus (SALT ALERT SEGWAY: WHY THE FUCK DOES HE STILL HAVE THIS CARD IN HIS DECK? LIKE COME ON, REALLY....FFS (Sidenote: Turns out he thought he did not have enough good cards to board in so had to keep some bad ones.....he had one left in the deck.)) So anyways  I go for it anyway and meet and Flusterstorm for my troubles. Again I try to rebuild but cannot interact meaningfully thanks to Leyline and not having boarded in any Bounce spells. I die to Mentor tokens and feel pretty angry.</p><h3 id="round&#95;2">Round 2</h3><p>**Player: ApeofJustice<br /> Opponent: Morgan<br /> Opposing Deck: Sneak and Show<br /> Result: 2-0**<br /></p><p>Playing against Morgan, who seemed to be somewhat new to the format. We all start somewhere. On the play.<br /> G1) Morgan mulligans to 6 cards and scrys to the top. I keep a pretty solid hand with cantrips,  mana and a burning wish. I T1 probe him, for information and see a pretty weak keep with Volcanic Island, Island, Mountain, Flooded Strand, Lotus Petal, and Force of Will. Seems pretty clearly on  some UR Show and Tell variant. Draw a duress from the probe which I use to take that Force and pass. Morgan just plays a land and passes, I draw a therapy and take that Petal, seeing the scry to the  top was a Griselbrand; confirm my assumption of SnT. I DR, BW, DD into a Pass the Turn pile. Kill  him the next turn.<br /> G2) I keep a very solid hand with Probe, Therapy, Therapy, Thoughtseize, Fetch, BW, LP. Morgan on the play plays a land, lotus petal, ponder (shuffle) and passes. I draw a LED.  Probe him seeing Boseiju, Flusterstorm, Show and Tell, Spell Pierce, and Brainstorm. Draw a  Dark Ritual off the Probe and go Dark Rit, Thoughtseize, Double therapy, leaving him with the  Brainstorm, and Boseiju. I go a couple more draw-gos with Morgan. I manage to brainstorm into Probe, Probe, Duress. Duress him see the coast is clear, play out my mana, and probe into the Probe then BW I put back ontop (With him on 19 and my storm currently 6), to go for an Empty the warrens for  16 goblins, and then flash back the 2 therapies from T1. He draws nothing relevant and concedes.<br /></p><p>**Player: Doishy<br /> Opponent: Justin<br /> Opposing Deck: BUG Delver<br /> Result: 2-1**<br /></p><p>Round 2 I face Justin on BUG Delver. I get the play and probe seeing a classic BUG hand. I  Duress away a Force of Will and T2 therapy away a Daze. He drops a Goyf T2 and I respond with 16 Goblins and a Flashbacked Therapy hitting Abrupt Decay T3. He scoops to my superior creature base! <br /> Game 2 I have the T1 unprotected. I jam it, he has a Surgical. Ah well.<br /> Game 3, We trade some resources then somewhere I find the spot to go off with Doomsday but  cannot hit the needed storm count so I manage to build a DD EtW pile with at least two turns  left of draw steps with 18 Goblins in play. He scoops. DD EtW pile. WUT?!<br /> This round I also enjoyed watching the lands mirror occurring to my left XD</p><h3 id="round&#95;3">Round 3</h3><p>**Player: ApeofJustice<br /> Opponent: Josh<br /> Opposing Deck: Turbo Depths<br /> Result: 0-2**  <br /></p><p>Playing against Josh, running Turbo Depths. On the Draw.<br /> G1) In the blind, I keep a fair 7, with a BW, DR, LP, Island, Fetch, Ponder, Brainstorm.  Josh leads with Urborg, then Needles Wasteland primitively. I draw another land, and feel  obliged to Wish for a Therapy to name Vampire Hexmage as a response to the threatening  T2 Marit Lage. Therapy reveals 3 Lotus Petals, 1 Elvish Spirit Guide, and a Crop Rotation. Josh topdecks an Expedition Map, tutors a Dark Depths and plays it, leaving a LP in play and ESG and a Rotation in hand. I know I’m dead next turn. Hope he misses it. I Brainstorm into cards to set up a PTT pile, attempt to set it up, but Josh makes a 20/20 in response to the Doomsday, and I concede.<br /> G2) Josh mulligans to 6 and scrys to the top. That scry feels a little threatening, I keep a solid hand with a T1 Thoughtseize, T2 Kill. I Thoughtseize him, seeing Dark Depths, Stage,  Karakas, Snow-covered Forest, Catacombs, and my only option of a Duress. Feel quietly hopeful.  Turns out his scry was a Thoughtseize as well, and he takes my doomsday, and I proceed to cast  my only cantrip (ponder) find 3 lands, shuffle draw a land, then continue flooding out. He Marit  Lages on T3 with a petal he drew.</p><p>**Player: Doishy<br /> Opponent: Mark<br /> Opposing Deck: Copy Paste<br /> Result: 0-2**<br /></p><p>Round 3 was against Mark on Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V. He is a Bristol local so both of us know the score.  G1 we manage to strip each other of hand resources but I have a good stable manabase and CB  in play (perfect start in the matchup). I need to find one last piece so have to aggressively  cantrip. I get rewarded by drawing lands three turns in a row to then find the kill (unprotected) in the face of lethal on the board and of course he has the force (I cannot Goblins due to double Flying Delvers).<br /> Game 2 starts off with an early Carpet (yay) and him getting manascrewed (WHAT?) so his one land,  T1 Delver, many Dazes hand does serious work as I cannot leverage my Carpet advantage, get beaten by the bug and then get into another turn where I have either the deterministic kill unprotected or a  YOLO CT + blind AoI what I think needed to be either an LED or DR to win? (It might have had to be  two cards maybe...) basically I went for it (deterministic kill) because I knew his hand was a R blast that I could ignore and 2 unknowns and hey, the unknowns were of course FoW and blue card. Blergh.</p><h3 id="round&#95;4">Round 4</h3><p>**Player: ApeofJustice<br /> Opponent: Mark<br /> Opposing Deck: Infect Result: 2-1**<br /></p><p>Playing against Mark who I knew is on Infect. I feel it’s a bad match up, and know that losing this would  put me out of top 8 contention. Unfortunately for Mark, he shows up a tad late to the match and received a game loss, so the match started 1-0 in my favour. On the draw.<br /> G1) I keep a slow grindy hand. Mark sticks a T1 Glistener Elf, and I die on T4 due to not hitting the action in my disruption and cantrip heavy hand.<br /> G2) Mark mulligans to 6 and scrys to the top, I keep a T2 kill if I draw a cantrip or LED. I have a Thoughtseize but decide to play a land and hold the thoughtseize, since I have the mana to cast it and combo next turn if  I can draw the cantrip. Mark plays a T1 Pithing Needle on LED and I inform him that it is infact a mana ability – feels bad man. (Editor's note: Mark knows better than this and I did slap him after because he's a pillock) I get the cantrip, Thoughtseize him, and see his only interaction was a Flusterstorm, which I take, then proceed to standard pile ToA kill him. </p><p>**Player: Doishy<br /> Opponent: Rosie<br /> Opposing Deck: Lands<br /> Result: 2-0**<br /></p><p>Round 4 I get the bye aka Lands.<br /> Game 1 she plays lands, I cantrip. As she ends her second turn she says "I know you're on Doomsday, but how does it actually work" to which I reply as I draw for turn "Let me show you". I do my thing  explaining each step then stack a Tendrils of Agony with 11 copies about to appear when she states she has a response. I know she has nothing in hand other than a Crop Rotation so I wonder what she plans to get. She rotates and grabs a Glacial Chasm and smugly puts it into play. I say okay and  ask if Storm triogger may resolve. She says yes so I point 12 Tendrils at her. She then points at Chasm to which I inform her regarding the wording difference of Damage vs Lifeloss. She looks  confused and queries it so I helpfully call the Judge to explain. <br /> Game 2 I probe to see a Choke in her hand (oh boy!). So I play a weirdly aggressive non U fetch game getting basic Island, Swamp and Badlands into play. She actually drops a T2 Sphere of Resistance so cannot cast Choke until T4 because she also blocks a Mox Diamond she draws with the Sphere. I  CT the Choke and manage to find a CoV. I enter T4 with four lands, the kill and CoV in hand. She drops a second choke. On her end step I QUICK MATHS (man's not hot) and work out I don't need my Island to win so Chain and Kill her.</p><h3 id="round&#95;5">Round 5</h3><p>**Player: ApeofJustice/Doishy Opponent: Doishy/ApeofJustic <br /> Opposing Deck: THE MIRROR!<br /> Result: Madness**    <br /></p><p><strong>ApeofJustice:</strong><br /></p><p>I played against Doishy.<br /> It was a wonderfully fun game and I couldn’t do this game justice with regards to the report. </p><p><strong>Doishy:</strong><br /></p><p>Round 5 is something truly special. Round 5 vs ApeofJustice on Doomsday.<br /> The 100% mirror.<br /> James on James, Doomsday on Doomsday action.<br /> It was everything everyone dreams of.<br /></p><p><img src="/img/MirrorMatch.png" alt="Game Faces" /></p><ul><li>Ape (Front) feeling the pressure as Doishy (Back) gets super srs.</li></ul><p>Game 1 he displays superior die skills and both of us wreck the hands of the other. He manages to Doomsday first but it's a bluff and he sets up an easy PTT pile. I school him by being  excellent at casting brainstorms and combo him out with a Storm pile and LM beats (did I mention I had a LM beating down during this game?). <br /> Game 2 he once again tries to imply foul things about my heritage by throwing 10 Goblins and a  flashbacked Cabal Therapy my way. I take a hit and, after checking what was up, state my inability to combat maths to then proceed to then Throw 14 Goblins down in response. (I think I managed  to CT two Doomsdays this game at some point). I am on 6 life at this point but find a Doomsday  so ignore the board because urgh, creatures and cast it setting up a CB ToA loop stack. He draws and SURGICALS ME, WHAT SORT OF DAMN PERSON BRINGS SURGICAL INTO A FIGHT BETWEEN GENTLEMEN?! It's probably fine as I now look at my five randomised cards. I draw the Tendrils first which then gets hit by Discard. Thankfully the next one drawn is AoI so I then storm him some and flunge with  SUPERIOR CREATURES for the rest. I then write down my 2-0 as an 0-2 because breakers and wanting Doomsday in the Top 8 over personal glory but alas it was for naught because there was a big tie of people on six points and who even knows how that shit works anyways?. </p><p><img src="/img/MIrrorMatchBoardState.png" alt="Dat Gamestate" /></p><ul><li>9 Goblins stare down 14 <del>Business Cards</del> Goblins as a Doomsday resolves.</li></ul><h2 id="ending&#95;thoughts">Ending Thoughts</h2><p><strong>ApeofJustice:</strong></p><p>I went 2-3 in actual matches. I feel that my opponents had a couple of particularly fortunate draws, but I was somewhat pleased with my overall play. I certainly still have some space for improvement, especially seeing the play from Doishy with his CB piles (something I very rarely do).  Either way, I had a tremendously fun event in Cardiff, and am glad to meet some of the people of this community.</p><p><strong>Doishy:</strong></p><p>3-2 overall but a fun day nonethless. Nice gloating point to note: My Standstill deck piloted by my friend Alex came second. His Semi  finals match was so glorious with Game 1 of it (vs Maverick) ending with his Opp having 0 permanents on the field and 2 cards (one was Teeg) in hand. Maindeck Crucible + Ghost Quarter + EE is so beautifull!  ANT won the event so gratz to Ben :)</p><p>It was great meeting ApeofJustice (though it transpires we had met before in years gone by) and I look fowards to schooling any other Doomsdayers in superior combat maths at GP Brum (look forward to my 0-8 drop report). </p>

        <h2>Pass-the-Turn Piles</h2>
		
    </div>
    
    <p>First of all, why would you ever want to cast Doomsday and then pass the  turn? The answer is simple: when you can't win otherwise. Pass the turn  piles help out when you can't win right now, because you lack mana  and/or draw effects, but you can't afford to wait much longer either. It  should be clear that pass the turn piles are practically never a very  desirable plan. When you make decisions like whether to keep a hand or  not, or when to cast your cantrips, going for a pass the turn pile  should serve as a last resort. The risks involved in paying half your  life rounded up and passing the turn are not to be underestimated.</p><p>In Legacy, discard is one of the most common strategies for disrupting  your opponent's plan. Therefore, many decks try to use discard to prevent  us from winning the game before they do. One of the main uses of pass  the turn piles is to become immune to discard. If you can't win right  now because you still lack some resources, but you can cast Doomsday and  dump other cards, like Lion's Eye Diamond or Conjurer's Bauble on  the table, you may be able to setup a win for next turn without giving  your opponent another window to discard any of your precious cards.</p><p>In some other (uncommon) situations building a pass the turn pile may be  your best shot at winning the game any time soon. For example, when you  lack a draw effect to draw in to your pile, but have everything else,  pass the turn piles may be an out. How you managed to end up in this  situation is a good question, in general, it's not a good idea to keep a  hand without sufficient filter/draw spells or use your cantrips too  aggressively and be a left with a Doomsday and no draw effect.</p><p>Now that we've made clear that pass the turn piles should basically  never be part of your plan, but may serve as an out in some situations,  we are ready to get started:</p><p>There is some good reason that you are going for a pass the turn pile  rather than winning this turn, either you lack resources or you have to  fight through some form of hate. Let's first talk about building pass  the turn piles because we lack resources, such as a draw effect or mana.  We'll focus on playing around/through hate later.</p><p>Consider the following (intentionally) bad example:<br /> You cast Doomsday, but lack a draw effect and therefore build:  </p><pre><code>-&gt; IU, LED, LED, GP, BW&#40;ToA&#41;.  
</code></pre><p>Next turn, for only UU you can draw and cast Ideas Unbound, followed by  2 Lion's Eye Diamonds and Gitaxian Probe into Burning Wish for Tendrils  of Agony for 6 storm. Although the mana cost of this procedure is very  low, the storm count is a bit of a disappointment. Fortunately, it's  easy to increase the storm count from this point on. If you have 1 more  mana you can build IU, LED, GP, CB, BW as a pile for 7 storm for  example. Together with some cards in hand to play out and some  self-inflicted damage from your opponent's fetchlands, that might just  be enough.</p><p>There are however some more solid ways of reaching winning the game even  after passing the turn, that still work if passing the turn is primarily  an anti-discard plan. The ones I will talk about in more detail are  using Laboratory Maniac, Time Spiral, and a second Doomsday.</p><h2 id="pass&#95;the&#95;turn&#95;piles&#95;with&#95;laboratory&#95;maniac">Pass the turn piles with Laboratory Maniac</h2><p>Laboratory Maniac enables some very mana efficient pass the turn piles  that may offer an out in situations where no other lethal pile would.  When you have no other cards in hand or play, for example because you've  used Lion's Eye Diamond to pay for Doomsday, the simplest pile is:</p><pre><code>-&gt; IU, CB, LED, GP, LM  1UU &#40;3&#41; 2 life
</code></pre><p>These piles do get a lot cheaper when you have an extra draw effect or  even LED.</p><pre><code>LED:
-&gt; GP, IU, CB, DR, LM  B &#40;1&#41; 2 life
-&gt; CB, TW, LED, GP, LM  1 &#40;1&#41; 2 life

GP in hand:
-&gt; LED, IU, CB, DR, LM  B &#40;1&#41; 2 life
-&gt; LED, IU, GP, LP, LM  1 &#40;1&#41; 4 life

CB in play:
-&gt; LED, TW, LED, GP, LM  0 &#40;0&#41; 2 life
</code></pre><p>Instead of using Lion's Eye Diamond to pay for Ideas Unbound/Three Wishes we can also include some other card into the pile, to for example play through some card in the opponent's hand. The mana cost for including another card depends on the location in the pile. There's also a trade-off between life and mana cost.</p><pre><code>GP in hand:
-&gt; Silence, IU, LP, GP, LM  W+2UU &#40;5&#41; 4 life
-&gt; LED, IU, Silence, GP, LM  W+2 &#40;3&#41; 4 life

LED:
-&gt; GP, TW, Silence, GP, LM  W+3 &#40;4&#41; 2 life
-&gt; GP, IU, Silence, GP, LM  W+2 &#40;3&#41; 4 life

CB in play:
-&gt; Silence, TW, LED, GP, LM  W+1UU &#40;4&#41; 2 life
-&gt; LED, TW, Silence, GP, LM  W+3 &#40;4&#41; 2 life
</code></pre><p>I've listed Silence because of its distinct mana cost, but you can  obviously replace the Silence with any other card. Examples are Duress,  Karakas, or perhaps even a Massacre.</p><p>For all pass the turn piles that don't assume a Conjurer's Bauble in play, you can replace the card that draws from an empty deck in the  Doomsday pile with Chromatic Sphere and increase the mana cost  accordingly to play around removal.</p><h2 id="time&#95;spiral&#95;pass&#95;the&#95;turn&#95;piles">Time Spiral Pass the Turn Piles</h2><p>The cost listed in square brackets [..] is assumingly payed for by the  lands are untapped by Time Spiral.</p><p>A simple example of a pass the turn pile that uses Time Spiral is as follows:</p><pre><code>-&gt; IU, LED, LED, BW&#40;TSP&#41;, BW&#40;ToA&#41;  UU+1R+&#91;1R&#93; &#40;4&#41; 9 Storm
</code></pre><p>Actually, if you have no other cards in hand or your post-Doomsday  graveyard resolving Time Spiral will kill you. The Doomsday you've cast  to build this pile typically ends up as the only card in your graveyard,  with 5 cards in your pass the turn pile this adds up to 6. However, the  Burning Wish used to wish for Time Spiral exiles itself, so that's only  5 cards. That's is why you need at least 2 random cards in your hand or  post-Doomsday graveyard to not kill yourself. Given that you have 2  extra cards that you may cast before and after the Time Spiral, as long  as they don't exile themselves or other cards, you might be able to up  to storm to well beyond 10. Also note, that the listed cost assumes that  you can produce 1R with the lands that you untap with Time Spiral.</p><p>Executing a Time Spiral pass the turn pile will become much easier if  you have some extra resources, like a Lion's Eye Diamond or a draw  effect. If you have both, a pass the turn pile would not be necessary  unless you're fighting through hate. Considering the following pile:</p><pre><code>LED in play + 1 card:
-&gt; IU, LED, LED, BW&#40;TSP&#41;, BW&#40;ToA&#41;  UU+&#91;1&#93; &#40;2&#41; 10 Storm
</code></pre><p>One important advantage of having an LED is that you don't require any  lands that produce red. Having access to a draw effect rather than a  Lion's Eye Diamond is unfortunately less effective. Consider the  following examples:</p><pre><code>CB in play + 1 card:
-&gt; IU, LED, LED, BW&#40;TSP&#41;, BW&#40;ToA&#41;  2UU+&#91;1R&#93; &#40;4&#41; 9 Storm
-&gt; LED, IU, LED, BW&#40;TSP&#41;, BW&#40;ToA&#41;  3R+&#91;1R&#93; &#40;4&#41; 9 Storm

-&gt; IU, LED, LED, BW&#40;TSP&#41;, BW&#40;ToA&#41;  2UU+&#91;2R&#93; &#40;4&#41; 10 Storm
-&gt; LED, IU, LED, BW&#40;TSP&#41;, BW&#40;ToA&#41;  3R+&#91;2R&#93; &#40;4&#41; 10 Storm
</code></pre><p>These piles are actually too mana-inefficient, in these situations it is  probably better to build a Doomsday pass the turn pile. It is not  possible to turn additional draw effects into mana, because we don't  have enough room in the pile and the whole procedure is actually quite  expensive mana wise: IU=2 + BW=2 + TSP=6 = 10 mana, with another 1R  post-TSP. As the 2 Burning Wishes and the Ideas Unbound already take up  3 spots, we only have room for 2 Lion's Eye Diamonds and these can be  easily drawn by Ideas Unbound, extra draw is not going to help.</p><p>This is of course no longer true if you already have Ideas Unbound or  Burning Wish, as you don't have to include them in the pile. Ideas  Unbound in hand is not that great as you will be very vulnerable to  discard. Having a Burning Wish in your hand or post-Doomsday graveyard  is better. You can use it to wish for Tendrils after Time Spiral, and  fill up its slot in the pile with another Lion's Eye Diamond. Examples:</p><pre><code>CB in play + BW in hand or graveyard:
-&gt; LED, TW, LED, LED, BW&#40;TSP&#41;  2+&#91;1R&#93; &#40;2&#41; 13 Storm

CB in play + IU in hand:
-&gt; LED, LED, LED, BW&#40;TSP&#41;, BW&#40;ToA&#41;  UU+&#91;1&#93; &#40;2&#41; 11 Storm
</code></pre><p>In summary, Time Spiral pass the turn piles are less specific to what  cards you need, but you need more (seven) cards in total. You need 2  cards in hand or post-DD graveyard to not kill yourself with Time  Spiral, the other 5 are searched with Doomsday. The only pile I usually  build is IU, LED, LED, BW, BW, unless I have IU or BW already in hand or  something. Winning on your next turn costs at most 1UUR. The extra 2  cards that you need can be used to lower the cost of the pile. It's  important to remember that after casting Time Spiral you need 1R for the  Burning Wish. Winning with the Time Spiral pile cost 1 more, when your  lands can't produce red mana. You can crack the 2 LEDs for RRRUUU, so if  you have 1 spare mana you can float R to ensure you'll be able to cast  Burning Wish post-Time Spiral.</p><h2 id="double-doomsday&#95;pass&#95;the&#95;turn&#95;piles">Double-Doomsday Pass the Turn Piles</h2><p>Compared to Time Spiral pass the turn piles, these are more expensive in  terms of life, but have different requirements in terms of mana and  cards. You can perform a Time Spiral pass the turn pile with 2 random  cards if you can produce 4 mana on the next turn. With double-doomsday  pass the turn piles you should remember that in general you need 1  specific card and 3 mana. I will leave whether or not we should regard  this as either less or more expensive up for discussion.</p><p>To convert a TSP pass the turn pile into a Doomsday pass the turn pile,  we replace a Burning Wish in the pile with a Doomsday. The problem is  that we also need some means of drawing into our second Doomsday pile.  If you did not have a Sensei's Divining Top in play already, you have to  replace some card in the pile with a draw effect. Preferably Conjurer's Bauble or AoI, as it allows us to sacrifice the 2nd LED in response to  Doomsday and include it in the second pile.<br /></p><pre><code>LED in play, PTT:
-&gt; TW/AoI, LED, GP, DD, BW          1UU/2R &#40;3&#41;         9 Storm
-&gt; TW/AoI, LED, LED, BW&#40;ToA&#41;, X

LED, CB in play, PTT:
-&gt; IU, LED, GP, BW, BW&#40;DD&#41;          1UUR   &#40;4&#41;         10 Storm
-&gt; IU, LED, LED, GP, BW&#40;ToA&#41;
</code></pre><h2 id="pass&#95;the&#95;turn&#95;cb&#95;piles">Pass the Turn CB piles</h2><p>Conjurer's Bauble can be used to increase storm despite an apparant lack of card resource. Remember that when you have a CB in play, one in the graveyard and no cards in your library you can loop them for the cost of (1) mana.<br /></p><pre><code>LED in play, PTT:
-&gt; IC, LED, CB, CB, ToA                  BBB+X &#40;3+X&#41;      9+X Storm
</code></pre><p>In the above example, what looks like a poor setup of only five spells can be used to enable a greater storm count. In the above example we cast IC (1) using the mana we used to cast DD the previous turn. We hold priority and crack LED for BBB. We then draw LED, CB, CB, ToA. We play LED (2) and use BB to cast both CBs (3,4). We then activate LED for BBB discarding ToA. We activate our first CB targeting LED, drawing it from our empty deck. We cast LED (5).  We now have BBBBBBB in our mana pool. We can use this with CB to activate  CB targeting the CB in the graveyard and loop them playing them again and again until we only have BBBB in our mana pool. In this base example this is for three  loops (6,7,8). We can then use the final one to target ToA and cast it for 9 storm.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><ol><li>You don't always have to win the turn you cast Doomsday</li><li>Pass the turn piles are effective when low on resource (cards or mana)</li><li>PTT piles do leave you susceptible to hand attack</li><li>There are tricks you can use to ensure you can build up enough storm so you don't always have to rely on LM</li></ol>

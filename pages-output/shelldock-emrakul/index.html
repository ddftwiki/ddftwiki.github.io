        <h2>Shelldock Isle/Emrakul Piles</h2>
    </div>
    
    <p>The interaction between Doomsday and Shelldock Isle is surprisingly  elegant. Once you resolve Doomsday you automatically fulfill the  otherwise strict condition on Shelldock Isle, but not only are you  allowed to activate Shelldock Isle, you also get to pick what cards will  be among the top 4 of your library for Shelldock Isle's Hideaway  ability. Even better, as Doomsday also allows you to search for  Shelldock Isle in the first place, it is basically a one-card combo!</p><h2 id="the&#95;basics">The Basics</h2><p>A very simple example of its use is as follows. Consider your opening  hand contains Underground Sea, Dark Ritual, Doomsday, you play all three  and build:</p><pre><code>-&gt; Shelldock Isle, Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, card 1, card 2, card 3.
</code></pre><p>Next turn you draw Shelldock Isle, play it and hideaway Emrakul. Pass  the turn. Next turn you untap Shelldock Isle, draw card 1, and cast  Emrakul. Take 1 extra turn. On your extra turn you draw card 2 and  attack with Emrakul. Pass the turn again. Untap, draw card 3, attack  with Emrakul.</p><p>As you notice, you get 2 Emrakul attacks before you have to draw a card  from an empty deck and get to draw 2 cards before your first Emrakul  attack.</p><p>As for the pile you build, it is generally safer to not make Shelldock  Isle the top card of your pile. Conjurer's Bauble is a much safer  choice, I myself have lost a game 3 because my opponent attacked with  Goblin Guide forcing the the Shelldock Isle to go to my hand. This  reduced the number of cards in my library and left me with only 1  Emrakul attack. Another reason not to make Shelldock Isle the top card  is the 'fateseal' ability of Jace, the Mind Sculptor and similar  effects. Whether Conjurer's Bauble is send to the bottom or not is  irrelevant, as you will have access to Shelldock Isle either way and  Conjurer's Bauble replaces a card to the bottom of you deck (in this instance normally the Doomsday cast to form the pile), thereby not reducing the  number of cards. As for your 2 other cards, consider a Dark Ritual and a  Doomsday to rebuild a library should you need extra Emrakul attacks, or  include 1 or 2 Dark Rituals and a Tendrils of Agony to some gain life or  quickly close out the game after 1 Emrakul attack.</p><p>The reason that we generally use Shelldock Isle is to hideaway and cast  an Emrakul, the Aeons Torn. Emrakul is one of the few cards that, once  cast, gives you a very good shot at winning the game on that card alone.  Not only will a single blow from the Annihilator 6 paired with 15/15 be  enough to directly kill or cripple your opponent, but Emrakul is also  uncounterable. This means that if you manage to resolve Doomsday, all  other spells you cast for the rest of that game will be uncounterable.  However, as Emrakul, the Aeons Torn is also frequently played in other  Legacy decks, cards that may answer Emrakul are also frequently played.</p><h2 id="playing&#95;around&#95;hate">Playing around hate</h2><p>Sorcery-speed hate for Emrakul, such as Oblivion Ring or similar cards as well as the abilities of planeswalkers such as  Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Liliana of the Veil can be easily played  around. First of all, this is only relevant if your opponent has more  than 6 permanents. However, the most elegant solution is to wait with  activating Shelldock Isle, pass the turn and cast Emrakul in your  opponent's end step. That way, you first get your extra turn, followed  directly by your actual turn. This gives you two consecutive turns in  which you can attack with Emrakul, without ever giving your opponent  another main phase. Another solution is to attack the planeswalker  instead of the player, but this may require that you cast another  Doomsday to refill your library.</p><p>The bigger issue is with permanents that may prevent your Emrakul from  attacking the first place, such as Ensnaring Bridge or Blazing Archon.  To deal with these you can include a bounce spell in the cards you  search with Doomsday. This is also the main reason that many Doomsday  lists used to include a 1-off Wipe Away in the sideboard. Also note that  we used to play around Karakas, simply by including our own 1-off  Karakas in the 5 cards you search with Doomsday and play Karakas right  before casting Emrakul. Unfortunately, this doesn't work anymore because  the legend rule changed with the M14 rules update. Karakas is currently  much harder to play around. It will probably cost you another sideboard  card if you really want it, perhaps Pithing Needle or Wipe Away, but if  you really want to spend a sideboard slot on this then why not throw in  an Omniscience? Spending an entire sideboard slot just to make Shelldock  Isle/Emrakul robust to Karakas is a huge investment though, you'd  probably only do this if your metagame is filled with UW Counterbalance  decks with plenty of Karakases in them.</p><p>More difficult hate to play around comes in the form of Wasteland and  Stifle. Stifle is particularly nasty as it can counter not only the  activation of Shelldock Isle, but more importantly also the Hideaway  trigger. Similar to Stifle, an opponent may cast Silence or Orim's Chant  in response to your Shelldock Isle activation, although your ability  will still resolve you won't be able to cast Emrakul since you're not  allowed to cast anything for the remainder of the turn. Also, don't  forget about cards that attack nonbasic lands such as Blood Moon or  Magus of the Moon, but these can be bounced more easily. Wasteland is  also very relevant as we are likely to pass the turn with a tapped  Shelldock Isle in play.</p><p>In theory, you might play a card that allows you to untap the Shelldock  Isle and exploit a window of opportunity when your opponent's Wasteland  is tapped or hasn't played one yet. Another possible advantage is that  it may speed up your win by a full turn. Many alternatives for this slot  have been tested, including Amulet of Vigor, Twiddle, Dream Salvage, and  so on, but all are inferior to Cloud of Faeries. The conclusion is that  Cloud of Faeries is better for several reasons:</p><ul><li>It cycles into your pile should you want to kill with Tendrils of Agony after all</li><li>Saves your Emrakul, the Aeons Torn from Diabolic Edict and similar effects</li><li>You need only 1 attack when opponent is on 16 and has no flying creatures</li><li>Cloud of Faeries can block a creature if your opponent has more than 6 permanents</li></ul><p>Most people suggesting Amulet of Vigor, think that it will allow them to  play around Wasteland, but they don't consider that the opponent can  just as well respond to the Hideaway trigger with Wasteland. Both  Twiddle and Amulet of Vigor are not cheaper in terms of mana than Cloud  of Faeries, this should be obvious. You will find that most lists don't  include any Cloud of Faeries/Twiddle/Amulet to go with the Emrakul plan,  simply because their use is too narrow. Even if it just takes up 1  additional sideboard slot is by many players considered not worth it.</p><p>Theoretically speaking, we already play a card that can be used to untap  lands: Time Spiral. However, Shelldock Isle typically removes 2 cards  (the land goes to the battlefield and exiles the hidden card) from the  cards that will form your new library before you draw 7. If you don't  want to kill yourself by drawing 7 cards of Time Spiral, note Time  Spiral also exiles itself, you need to have 4 cards in your hand or  post-Doomsday graveyard. And that's not including the cards you will  draw in the turn(s) that you attack with Emrakul. So this is probably  not feasible in practice.</p><p>One nice thing is that if you get the Shelldock Isle in hand, if the opponent holds a Surgical Extraction or draws into it for their turn then it does nothing to disrupt the pile as Hideaway digs four cards deep thereby encompassing the whole  pile. Be warned however as if you do decide to include a secondary Doomsday in the pile they can extract it off of the one in your Graveyard thereby reducing  the number of turns you have before decking yourself by one. The presence of a Conjurer's Bauble can help remove this risk by replacing the targeted spell back into the deck.</p><h2 id="sample&#95;games&#95;from&#95;tournament&#95;reports">Sample games from tournament reports</h2><p>These snippets from older tournament reports demonstrate a couple of real  situations where Shelldock Isle/Emrakul won the game while playing  around or through hate (They are excerpts from before the banning of Sensei's  Divining Top hence the inclusion of references to it).</p><p>[bennotsi 14-01-2013]<br /> Game 2 against a red Godo MUD deck. I open Flooded Strand, Dark Ritual, Doomsday, Shelldock Isle, Chain of Vapor, Abrupt Decay. So Turn 1 figured I just go for it as he used his Wastelands quite aggressively game 1, that's why I boarded in the Shelldock Isle/Emrakul anyway. Flooded Strand fetches Underground Sea DR->DD building:<br /> Thoughtseize<br /> Emrakul<br /> Island<br /> Dark Ritual<br /> Doomsday<br /> He plays Great Furnace and passes.<br /> My turn I cast Thoughtseize looking at Blood Moon, Mindbreak Trap (he had it turn 1), Great Furnace, City of Traitors and Wasteland. So I decide to start the Jedi Mindtricking :-) While looking at the cards and reading at loud what he has I simply  ignored that the Wasteland might ever be relevant. "A Mindbreak Trap, a  Blood Moon and 3 lands, OK." He puts his Mindbreak Trap in his  graveyard, still assuming I'm going to kill him using storm. Instead I  tell him to put the Blood Moon in his graveyard instead. I drop  Shelldock Isle hideaway Emrakul. He topdecks Blood Moon and gets excited  enough to cast it, not realizing that he should have wasted my Shelldock  Isle :-D On my turn I draw my basic Island, use it to bounce Blood Moon  with Chain of Vapor, then use Underground Sea to activate Shelldock  Isle, he's dead.</p><p>[Lejay 02-01-2013]<br /> Game 3 gainst TES. I mulligan twice (no land, no land) to this hand of 5 cards: Delta, Sea, DR, DD, LED.<br /> Keeping a 5 on the play without SDT and disruption will probably end up badly but 4 cards is too low. So I have to carefully optimize my chances. I decide to play delta->Scrubland DR DD LED go building<br /> SDT<br /> Silence<br /> Shelldock Isle<br /> Emrakul<br /> Doomsday (cast with SDT+LED)<br /> This way I don't fear discard and can realistically combo through one chant, maybe in resp to his own one play chant + activate shelldock during his turn. I'm all in and at 9.<br /> He thinks forever in his turn 1 so I thought I was dead for the first minute but he finally decides to play Ponder (no shuffle) and then Petal. I play SDT in my turn. In his turn he does nothing. I look with SDT end of turn to put shelldock on top and hideaway in my turn. On his turn he plays Chrome Mox imprinting Rite of Flame. Thinks for a while and then play Silence. I flip SDT and Silence in resp. On my turn I activate shelldock and cast another DD with SDT+Silence on top. Take another turn, annihilate his board, and flip SDT to then play Silence in his upkeep.</p><p>[climax 28-05-2012]<br /> Game 3 against Reanimator: It boils down to me resolving a Doomsday for  a shelldock pile featuring Karakas as the 4th card. I can't chant walk  him the turn after, so he's able to reanimate Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite  and Griselbrand while I'm at 8 life or less. I realize that I can't play  Shelldock Isle or I lose so I spin my top and draw Karakas and play it  over SI. He draws 7 with Griselbrand putting him to lethal from one  swing of emrakul. I bounce Griselbrand and go to 4 life from elesh norn  and he passes back discarding some reanimation targets and useless  cards. I replay my top, he force's which is fine by me. I lay down  shelldock isle and bounce elesh norn when he attacks with it. He  reanimates 2 dudes. I play a bigger dude that time walks. I win.</p><p>[Lejay 22-05-2012]  Game 3 against UW Counterbalance. We exchange cards and at one point I just have the mana to play DD with no cards in hand while he fulltapped for Jace, the Mind Sculptor with Karakas in play. I build<br /> Sensei's Divining Top<br /> Shelldock Isle<br /> Karakas<br /> Emrakul<br /> Doomsday<br /> Because my opponent had Karakas + Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The SDT prevented my opponent from fatesealing me twice (2nd time is post shelldock). Karakas destroyed his Karakas. I generally don't put Emrakul next after shelldock in case they clique another card from my hand. Doomsday allowed me to reshuffle cards and not die by decking. Attack Jace to avoid the bounce effect on Emrakul. Attack twice FTW.</p>
